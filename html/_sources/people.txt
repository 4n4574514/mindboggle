    `Arno Klein`_ (arno@binarybottle.com, CV_) directs two groups at `Sage Bionetworks`_ in Seattle:
    Neuroimaging, which analyzes biomedical image data, and SIMPL(E),
    which seeks and interprets meaningful patterns and latent explanations
    in data. Arno is particularly excited about imaging and visualization
    of complex information. He is actively involved in a range of `projects`_,
    including visual taxonomies, Indian cave temple documentation,
    and is coordinating open science challenges.

    `Arno Klein`_ (CV_) is a Research Asst. Professor of Psychiatry and Behavioral Science
    at Stony Brook University.
    He was the Principal Investigator of the NIMH R01 grant (MH084029-02) 
    that initially funded the Mindboggle project.
    Arno is excited about brain imaging and visualization of complex information.
    He has conducted research in 3-D display holography from a high school basement lab to MIT's Media Lab,
    tissue optics at Caltech, and automated anatomical brain labeling and shape analysis at Cornell
    and at Columbia Universities.  
    Side projects include the comprehensive photodocumentation of the
    `Ellora cave temples`_ of India, taxonomic classification of `information visualization`_,
    time-lapse photography, and text parsing and analytics.

    Nolan is developing the informatics infrastructure underlying Mindboggle using a Semantic Web 
    technology stack that explicitly models data provenanceâ€‹.
    He is excited about the translational aspects of the Mindboggle project, 
    and finds this effort to be a nice complement to his thesis work in the areas of 
    semantic data integration and sharing of human neuroimaging data.

    image registration and processing of longitudinal brain MRI data implemented in FreeSurfer. 
    His research interests include computational neuroimaging, computational geometry and toplogy. 
    Mindboggle's Laplace-Beltrami spectra code is a Python port of Martin's Matlab version. 
    Martin has helped the team to develop and evaluate this spectral shape measure.
